Say Hello App
Introduction
Welcome to my first Android Studio project! 🎉
The Say Hello App is a simple Android application that takes a user's name as input and displays a personalized greeting. This project helped me explore the basics of Android development, including UI design, event handling, and deploying apps to physical devices.

Features
Enter your name in a text field.
Tap the "Say Hello" button to see a personalized greeting.
Simple and beginner-friendly interface.

For example:
